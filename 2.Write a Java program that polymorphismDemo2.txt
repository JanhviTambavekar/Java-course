2.Write a Java program that demonstrates method overriding by creating a superclass called Animal and two subclasses called Dog and Cat. ● The Animal class should have a method called makeSound(), which simply prints "The animal makes a sound." ● The Dog and Cat classes should override this method to print "TheCat/The dog meows/barks" respectively. ● The program should allow the user to create and display objects of each class.

package demo;
 class Animal {
public void makeSound()
{
	 System.out.println("The animal makes a sound.");	 
}
}
 class cat extends Animal {
	 public void makeSound()
	 {
		 System.out.println("The dog barks."); 
	 }
	 }
 class Dog extends Animal 
 {
	    public void makeSound() 
	    {
	        System.out.println("The cat meows.");
	    }
	}
 import java.util.Scanner;

 public class polymorphismDemo2 {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
         
         System.out.println("Choose an animal: 1. Dog 2. Cat");
         int choice = scanner.nextInt();
         
         Animal animal;
         
         if (choice == 1) {
             animal = new Dog();  
         } else if (choice == 2) {// Polymorphism: Animal reference to Cat object
         } else {
             System.out.println("Invalid choice.");
             scanner.close();
             return;
         }
         
         animal.makeSound();  
         scanner.close();
     }
 }


OUTPUT

1
The dog barks.
2
The cat meows.
