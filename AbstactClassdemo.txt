3.Create abstract class vaccine.Create two variables age(int),nationality(String).create 2 concrete methods firstDose() and secondDose(). Scenario 1:user can take the first dose if the user is Indian and age is 18.After vaccination the user has to pay 250rs(which will be displayed on the console). Scenario 2: Users are eligible to take the second dose only after completing the first dose. Scenario 3: create abstract method boosterDose() in abstract class Vaccine.Create one implementation class vaccinationSuccessful, where implement boosterDose() method. Create main class vaccination and invoke all methods accordingly. [Hint:Create constructor to initialize variables age and nationality,Use flow control(Ifelse) to check condition]

OUTPUT

Enter your age: 30
Enter your nationality: Indian
First dose taken. Please pay 250 rs.
Second dose taken. You are now fully vaccinated.
Booster dose taken. You are now fully protected.

Enter your age: 47
Enter your nationality: Indian
You are not eligible for the first dose.
You must complete the first dose before taking the second dose.
Booster dose taken. You are now fully protected.
