Create a class named "User" with the following properties and methods: Properties: id(int): representing the id of the User name(String):representing the name of the User Constructor: Declare parameterized constructor to initialize id and name. Create a subclass named "Employee" that inherits from the "User" class. Add the following additional properties and methods: Properties: salary(double):representing the monthly salary of the employee Method: double calculateAnnualSalary():to calculate the annual salary earned by the employee. In the main method, create an object of "Employee" class. Calculate the annual salary of the employee and display it.. [Hint:Use constructor or setter methods to set the value]
